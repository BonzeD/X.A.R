# XAR Canon Document  
**Official Universe Ruleset**

---

## 1. General Status of XAR

**XAR (X-Agency of Response)** is a covert international rapid-response organization operating outside public legal frameworks.

- XAR does not officially exist in any country.
- It is funded through layered government programs, private contractors, and classified security budgets.
- XAR operates globally and autonomously.
- Despite its secrecy, XAR is **not a terrorist organization**.

**Core definition:**  
XAR exists to intervene where conventional forces cannot act fast enough, openly enough, or precisely enough.

---

## 2. Ethical and Moral Framework

### 2.1 Civilian Protection

- XAR **does not intentionally allow terrorist attacks against civilians**.
- Civilian casualties are classified internally as:
  - **Operational failure**, even if objectives are achieved.
- Missions are designed to minimize collateral damage at all costs.

### 2.2 Acceptable Actions

XAR permits:
- Covert operations
- Identity fabrication
- Data manipulation
- Disinformation
- Targeted eliminations of high-risk individuals

XAR does **not** permit:
- Mass casualty events as strategy
- Sacrificing civilians for intelligence alone
- Chaos without strategic containment

> The former doctrine of “documents over lives” is **non-canonical and abolished**.

## 3. Agent Rotation, Sleep, and Recovery

### 3.1 Operational Rotation Protocol

- All field units are assigned to one of three states:
  - **Active**
  - **Reserve**
  - **Recovery**
- Only specific units are on active duty per operational cycle.
- Units rotate to prevent burnout, psychological collapse, and tactical degradation.

### 3.2 Sleep Doctrine

- Sleep is considered a **critical operational resource**.
- Mandatory rest periods are enforced unless threat level reaches **Red** or higher.
- Chronic sleep deprivation triggers automatic suspension from missions.

> Raven is canonically known to violate this protocol.

---

## 4. Agent Living Conditions

- Agents live either:
  - On secured XAR bases
  - In XAR-owned residential facilities under civilian cover identities
- No permanent civilian homes are allowed.
- Average deployment readiness time: **15–30 minutes**.

Civilian life is intentionally minimized to preserve secrecy and response speed.

---

## 5. Command Authority and Autonomy

### 5.1 Command Core

- Defines mission objectives and threat priorities.
- Does not micromanage field execution.

### 5.2 Field Authority

- Field leaders may:
  - Modify plans
  - Abort missions
  - Override orders
- Disobedience is acceptable **if it prevents civilian loss or total mission failure**.

---

## 6. Personal Relationships Canon

- Officially discouraged.
- Practically tolerated.
- XAR recognizes that trust and emotional bonds increase field effectiveness.

Raven and Honi’s bond is:
- Known
- Documented
- Strategically tolerated due to performance metrics

---

## 7. Technology and Prosthetics

- Biomechanical prosthetics are experimental.
- Prosthetic malfunction = immediate operational suspension.
- Unauthorized self-modification is prohibited.

Exception:
- If modifications succeed operationally, violations may be quietly ignored.
- If injury occurs, responsibility lies fully on the agent.

---

## 8. Information Integrity

- XAR may manipulate external data freely.
- Internal data integrity is **absolute**.
- Any internal falsification is treated as:
  - Level Black threat
  - Internal sabotage

---

## 9. Media and Public Perception

- Public is unaware of XAR’s existence.
- Media narratives often misinterpret or vilify operations.
- Civil unrest caused by misinformation is a recognized risk.

Public exposure of an agent is classified as:
- Extreme breach
- Only acceptable under extraordinary circumstances

---

## 10. The Raven Canon (Critical)

- Raven is a tactical prodigy with a self-destructive responsibility complex.
- He consistently chooses plans where:
  - The team survives
  - He does not

This is not heroism.
This is psychological distortion caused by trauma, war, and leadership burden.

---

## 11. Series Structure Canon

- Total seasons: **2**
- Series finale:
  - Raven dies
  - Honi becomes leader of a new unit
- XAR continues to exist.
- The world is saved.
- The cost is personal, not abstract.

---

## 12. Core Theme of the Universe

XAR is not about winning wars.

It is about:
- Invisible sacrifices
- People who protect a world that will never know their names
- The cost of being effective in silence
