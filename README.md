##  About the Project

**XAR** is an independent animated series project built around an original universe of covert operations, moral ambiguity, and deeply human characters.

The story follows a small operative team working for **XAR (X-Agency of Response)** — an unofficial global organization operating in the shadows.  
The project focuses not only on action, but on **characters, consequences, media distortion, trust, and loss**.

This repository contains:
- animation files and scenes  
- project structure and assets  
- story-related elements used for production  
- technical experiments and pipelines

##  Purpose

This project is **open-source** and created for:

-  **Learning animation** (timing, staging, atmosphere, cinematography)
-  **Studying storytelling** in animated form
-  **Experimenting with workflows** (Blender / animation tools)
-  **Remixing or improving** the project for personal or educational use

You are free to:
- explore the files  
- learn from the structure  
- modify, improve, or build your own project based on it

— this project is for you.
